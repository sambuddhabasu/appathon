#HungryMe

This app was made during an appathon


The 'HungryMe' app is focused on targeting the whole society at large. This app lets users search for food recipes based on the ingredients they have with them. The result is sorted according to the rating of the recipe. Once a recipe is uploaded from the app, other users can see it and rate it. Rating up/down will in turn modify the rating of the user who had uploaded the recipe. The leaderboard helps to make sure that users contribute as much as possible.
 
 
After the app switches on, users can either login or signup to start using the app. After logging in, the users will be redirected to their profile page. Users can view other recipes, add new ones and also see the top 10 contributors on the leaderboard.
